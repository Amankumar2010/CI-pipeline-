# 🚀 CI Pipeline – Python Project

This repository contains a simple **CI pipeline** for running Python scripts using **GitHub Actions**.  
It’s designed to run in **ARM-based environments** and avoids system-wide package installation issues by using a **virtual environment**.

## ⚙️ CI Workflow Overview

The workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) performs the following steps:

1. **Trigger**
   - Runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
   
2. **Environment**
   - Uses Ubuntu runners with ARM architecture.
   
3. **Steps**
   - Checks out the repository code.
   - Sets up Python 3.12.
   - Creates and activates a **virtual environment**.
   - Installs project dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Runs the main Python script.

## 🛠️ Local Development

To run the script locally:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python your_script.py
```
✅ Notes
PEP 668 Compliance – Avoids externally-managed-environment errors by using a virtual environment instead of installing system-wide packages.

Replace your_script.py with the actual entry point of your project.

Update requirements.txt as your dependencies change.
